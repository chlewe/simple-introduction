\label{ch:verifiable}

% mapping of bits to types
% for verification purposes: formal specification that works in Coq etc.


% Enable useful static analysis to bound computational resource usage of programs.
% Provide formal semantics for reasoning with off-the-shelf proof-assistant software.

% jets: verified C
% Capture the computational environment entirely within a unit of transaction.
